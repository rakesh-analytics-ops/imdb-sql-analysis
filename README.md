# 🎬 IMDb Movie Analytics

This project focuses on analyzing an **IMDb-style movie dataset** using SQL and Python.
The goal is to explore trends related to movies, genres, ratings, directors, and audience votes.

This project was done mainly to **strengthen SQL and analytical thinking** using a dataset
that is easy to understand and relatable.

## 📌 Why I did this project

Movies generate a lot of structured data, which makes them perfect for practicing:
- SQL queries
- data filtering and aggregation
- analytical questioning

Instead of solving random SQL questions, I wanted to analyze a dataset end-to-end and
derive meaningful insights.

## 🧠 What I worked on

In this project, I analyzed:
- rating distributions across movies
- genre-wise trends
- director-wise and actor-wise performance
- relationship between ratings and number of votes
- basic hypothesis testing on movie ratings

The focus was on **logic and interpretation**, not just writing queries.

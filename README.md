🎬 IMDB SQL Analysis

This project is created to practice SQL using a real-world type movie dataset.
I used IMDB-style data to understand how movies, ratings, genres, and votes can be analyzed using SQL queries.

The main focus of this project is learning by doing, not just writing queries but understanding why a query is needed.

📌 Why I did this project

As someone preparing for Data Analyst roles, SQL is a core skill.
Instead of solving only theoretical questions, I wanted to work on a dataset that feels realistic and relatable.

Movies are easy to understand, which makes it easier to focus on logic, joins, and analysis, rather than memorizing syntax.

📂 About the Dataset

The dataset contains movie-related information such as:

movie name

release year

genre

IMDB rating

number of votes

duration

The data is structured in tables so that I can practice JOINs and relational thinking.

🧠 What I did in this project

In this project, I wrote SQL queries to:

filter movies based on ratings and release year

find top-rated and most-voted movies

analyze how ratings differ across genres

calculate averages using GROUP BY

apply conditions using WHERE and HAVING

use JOINs to combine multiple tables

While writing queries, I focused on writing clean and readable SQL, not just getting the output.

🔍 Sample Questions I Answered

Which movies have the highest IMDB ratings?

Which genres have the most movies?

What is the average rating for each genre?

Which movies received the highest number of votes?

How have movie ratings changed over the years?

🛠️ Tools Used

SQL

MySQL / PostgreSQL-style queries

Any SQL editor (MySQL Workbench / DB Browser)

GitHub for version control

✅ What I learned

How to think in tables instead of Excel sheets

When to use WHERE vs HAVING

How JOINs actually work in real datasets

How small changes in queries can change results

Writing SQL in a way that others can easily read

⚠️ Limitations

Dataset is limited and used mainly for practice

No visualization is included in this project

🔮 What I plan to do next

Add more complex queries using CTEs

Practice window functions

Connect SQL output with Power BI for visualization
